# Extensive Todo List for Possible Projects

TODO Baptiste
> Force Controller [Baptiste]

> Action Server

> Parameter Tuning


Sequence recording:
> [Bapstiste] Scale up velocity / Keep it at max

> [Lukas] Decrease sampling > currently at 0.5


URGENT:
> Compliant Mode

> Arrows to move up & down

> TEST (!) with Motion (Simulator)

> Error handling for empty recording!

> Movement States: Movement sent, movement recieved, movement 
(Potentially: Align with action?)

> DS handler! [Speed etc.]

> Force Parameter (ros_handler)

> Velocity Parameter (ros_handler)

> Clear everything at shutdown..

> Include force in direct module replay(!!!) + check if cancelled


URGENT:
> Touchstart at right screen side (show menu) is currently passive. This does not allow for event.preventDefault() ! Fix it...

> Number input on touch pad (!?) + Arrows

> Only one path / trajectory

# Fixes
> Don't update when blocks are only 'moved' & update block only
Status: postponed


# Features
> AI / Learning algorithms

> Visualize Robot
Status: postponed

> Include time in recording?
Status: postponed

> Status: maybe (?)

> Submodules (!)

> Global check if everything is saved.

> Code-Generation / Python based
status: postponed / how or why should this be done

> Learn Motion (send to file)
status: investigatio for best use

> Get Reference Frames (?) HOW?
status: not urgent

> Hide show Menus

> Tabs for properties

> Tabs for position previous next

> Use IMU to move

> Connect to Robots (Add new robots)

> Matrix-based positioning of pieces (how to implement)

> Nice AICA logo transition (...)

> Delete Modules 

> Create 'clean-file'

> 


# Update / Improvement
> Improved storage structure!
Status: postponed
